# Data@ANZ Virtual Internship Program
This repository contains my work and solutions to the [ANZ](https://www.anz.com.au/personal/) Australia's [Data@ANZ Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/ZLJCsrpkHo9pZBJNY/Data@ANZ%20Program) hosted on the [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) platform.

## About
ANZ is one of the big four banks in Australia and their Data@ANZ Program is about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo, to deliver on their purpose to shape a world where people and communities thrive. Thought this experience, ANZ aims to distill unique insights from the data that will enable them take actions.

## Main Objective
This virtual experience program seeks to explore the transactional behaviour of ANZ customers by examining a synthesised transaction dataset containing transactions made by 100 hypothetical customers over a period of 3 months. These transactions include purchases, recurring transactions and salary transactions.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.

- Load the transaction dataset below into an analysis tool of your choice (Excel, R, SAS, Tableau, or similar)
- Start by doing some basic checks – are there any data issues? Does the data need to be cleaned?
- Gather some interesting overall insights about the data. For example -- what is the average transaction amount? How many transactions do customers make each month, on average?
- Segment the dataset by transaction date and time. Visualise transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week. Consider the effect of any outliers that may distort your analysis.
- For a challenge – what insights can you draw from the location information provided in the dataset?

## Task 2: Predictive Analytics
Explore correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on your findings.

- Using the same transaction dataset, identify the annual salary for each customer
- Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.
- Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
- How accurate is your model? Should ANZ use it to segment customers (for whom it does not have this data) into income brackets for reporting purposes?
- For a challenge: build a decision-tree based model to predict salary. Does it perform better? How would you accurately test the performance of this model?
